\begin{abstract}
The unitarization of the longitudinal vector boson scattering (VBS) cross section by the Higgs boson is 
a fundamental prediction of the Standard Model which has not been experimentally verified. In the first LHC run, 
both ATLAS and CMS collaborations presented first studies of VBS processes in events with two leptonically-decaying same-electric-charge 
$W$ bosons produced in association with two jets. This channel has the advantage of smaller backgrounds 
compared to other VBS channels while still exhibiting a detectable production rate. However, the angular distributions of the leptons in the $W$ boson rest frame, which are commonly used to 
fit polarization fractions, are not readily available in this process due to the presence of two neutrinos in the final state. 
In this paper we present a method to circumvent this problem by using a deep machine learning technique to recover these angular distributions from measurable event kinematics to determine the longitudinal fraction.  The method presented here could be used as well in other VBS channels with neutinos(s) in the final state.

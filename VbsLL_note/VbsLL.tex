\begin{abstract}
The unitarization of the longitudinal vector boson scattering (VBS) cross section by the Higgs boson is 
a fundamental prediction of the Standard Model which has not been experimentally verified. In the first LHC run, 
both ATLAS and CMS collaborations presented the first studies of VBS processes in events with two leptonically-decaying same-sign 
$W$ bosons produced in association with two jets. This channel has the advantage of having smaller backgrounds 
compared to other VBS channels. 
%However, the presence of two neutrinos in the final state makes full kinematic event reconstruction 
%and evaluation of the longitudinal scattering fraction difficult. 
However, the angular distributions of the leptons in the $W$ boson rest frame, which are commonly used to 
fit polarization fractions, are not readily available due to the presence of two neutrinos in the final state. 
In this paper we present a method to circumvent this problem by using deep machine learning technique to 
recover the angular distributions from measurable event kinematics and to determine the longitudinal fraction. 
We also compare the results obtained from this method and from other traditional methods. Our method could be 
used in other VBS channels with neutinos(s) in the final state.

\begin{abstract}
The unitarization of the longitudinal vector boson scattering (VBS)
cross section by the Higgs boson is a fundamental prediction of the
Standard Model which has not been experimentally verified. In the
first LHC run, both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations presented first
studies of VBS processes in events with two leptonically-decaying
same-electric-charge $W$ bosons produced in association with two jets.
This channel has the advantage of smaller backgrounds compared to
other VBS channels while still exhibiting a detectable production
rate.  However, the angular distributions of the leptons in the $W$
boson rest frame, which are commonly used to fit polarization
fractions, are not readily available in this process due to the
presence of two neutrinos in the final state.  In this paper we
present a method to circumvent this problem by using a deep machine
learning technique to recover these angular distributions from
measurable event kinematics to determine the longitudinal scattering
fraction.  We compare the results obtained from this method with other
traditional methods. The method presented here can be used as well in
other VBS channels with neutrino(s) in the final state.

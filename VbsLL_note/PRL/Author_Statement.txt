Our paper presents a significant step toward solving the long standing problem measuring of longitudinal Vector Boson Scattering (VBS). Longitudinal VBS is an integral part of Electroweak symmetry breaking, and its measurement has been a goal of High Energy physics for several decades. We address this problem with modern machine learning techniques, and show that we can double the LHC's experimental sensitivity to this process. We feel that the increase in this sensitivity is particularity noteworthy, but also that the techniques we have develop are applicable to many applications making our result of general interest.

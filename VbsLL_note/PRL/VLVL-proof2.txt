Dear editors,

please find our responses and comments 
on the second proof below.

Best regards,
The authors.


Q: Please check that all references include complete titles.
-> [22] and [26] are still missing titles - they should be:
   [22]: "Approximation by Superpositions of a Sigmoidal Function"
   [26]: "Theano: A CPU and GPU Math Compiler in Python"

1 Second Proof: Please check closely to confirm all of the corrections have been 
  incorporated properly throughout this article.

-> OK

2 Second Proof: Please check and approve the paper is ready to be published in its 
  current form.

-> Unfortunately, there are more corrections - see below.

3 Second proof: Please note that as per PRD journal guidelines the punctuations should 
  be always present inside the quotation marks, for e.g. (,) and (.). Hence your requested 
  correction could not be done.

-> OK

4 Second proof: Please note that as per PRD journal style guidelines the “%” symbol 
  should be repeated when the parentheses is removed. Hence we have added the percentage
  symbol on both sides as 6.7% \pm 1.4%. Please check the updated changes.

-> OK

5 Second proof: Please check the insertion of article title in all references.
-> Please implement the following corrections:
l.328: "W+’s" -> "$W^+$’s"
       "like sign" -> "like-sign"
l.332: remove "The"
l.333: "High-Energies" -> "High Energies"	
l.336: "high-energies" -> "high energies"
       "Higgs boson" -> "Higgs-boson"
l.351: "High-Energy" -> "High-energy"
l.352: "Higgs discovery" -> "Higgs boson discovery"
l.362: "WpmWpmjj" -> "$W^\pm W^\pm jj$"
l.376: "collider physics" -> "Collider Physics"
l.381: "Vector-Vector" -> "Vector-vector"
l.385: "WW" -> "$WW$"
l.389: remove "The"
l.396: "Mathematics of control, signals and systems" -> Approximation by Superpositions of a Sigmoidal Function"
l.399: "deep inelastic" -> "deep-inelastic"
l.401: "Multivariate analysis methods in particle physics" -> "Multivariate Analysis Methods in Particle Physics"
l.423: "A Brief Introduction" -> "A brief introduction"
l.428: "A modular" -> "a modular"
l.431: "Anti-k(t)" -> "anti-$k_{\rm t}$"


General comments and corrections
================================
F1:3 Please change "are shown with arbitrary units (arb. units) (a),(c) are projections" to
     "are shown with arbitrary units (arb. units). (a), (c) are projections"

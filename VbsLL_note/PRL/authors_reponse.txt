Report of Referee A -- LK14763/Searcy

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an interesting, very readable paper. The use of deep learning
NNs to actually calculate an under constrained quantity in particle
physics is new to me.
I have a number of serious comments though and it works best to attach
them to the plots:

Fig 1a: it compares LL, -- and ++ according to the labeling, but in
fact in only shows a single cos theta* distribution for +, - and L.

Authors:This plot shows cos theta* distribution for the first lepton in LL, -- and ++ events. The distribution for 
the first and the second leptons are the same since we do not label two leptons in a particular order. 
We think it is better easier to make comparisons in 1D instead of 2D for clarity. We modified the caption to clarify what is
being shown.


Fig 1b: the log scale is necessary but makes a meaningful comparison
with the NN impossible.

Authors:We agree with you. We modified the caption to emphasize the scale difference for these two plots. We 
compared the uncertainty on the fitted LL fraction using both variables quantitatively in the text.


Fig 1c: the x-axis is cos theta NN and not cos theta*. Since this is
the distribution used in the template fit, it is not possible to cut
on it to suppress background, so why show it. The actual background
shape can be derived from data using fully reconstructed (3 lepton)
background and removing the appropriate lepton. Probably this figure
can go.

Authors:We corrected the label of the x-axis to cos theta NN. It may be possible to use 3-leptons data events to 
derive the cos theta NN distribution as you suggested, we feel this figure is interesting because it shows 
the discrimination power of this variable between the signal and dominant background.

Fig2: Confusing, if cos theta_1 NN and cos theta_2 NN are correlated
maybe 3 different 2D plots would be best, if not a 1-D distribution
would be a lot clearer.

Authors:We followed your suggestions to add three 2D plots to show the differences for cos theta NN 1 vs 2 
correlations, but we also want to keep the original 1D plot that clearly demonstrate the fitting procedure 
and also the fraction from each template. 

Fig3: part a and b are not realistic and therefore not relevant and
can go, only use c. The x-axis should be integrated luminosity. In
general, even the realism of c) is limited. To obtain a dataset of
several ab-1 years of running with high pile-up is needed. The issue
of pile-up, leading to misidentification of the tagging jets and
decreasing the precision of the missing Et measurement is not
addressed at all. While I expect the deep learning NN still to
outperform the Rt method, the most realistic and difficult scenario
does not look good for a meaningful LL measurement

Authors:We agree with you that parts a) and b) are not realistic, but we think these two plots provides additional 
information about these detector effects on the LL fraction measurement. For example when comparing a) 
to b) you can see that the cuts used significantly impact the significance implying optimization could be 
possible. Similarly from b) to c) shows the degradation on the final sensitivity due to finite detector 
resolutions and detection efficiencies. This has been clarified in the text.
In regards to c) pile-up was in part included in the Delphes parameterization. Mis-tagged jets, however, in this case are not
a major concern, since they are generally easily rejected by increased pt cuts. This can be performed with almost no loss of efficiency 
because of the already relatively high M(j,j) cuts.

Report of Referee B -- LK14763/Searcy

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The paper outlines the use of a machine learning technique,
specifically, the use of deep neural networks, to measure WW
polarization fractions in events with two same sign W bosons and two
hadronic jets. These measurements and study of vector boson scattering
are important to carry out at the LHC and particularly at the high
luminosity LHC.

Neural networks method has been used extensively in High Energy
Physics for almost 25 years now. Recently, the CMS collaboration used
it in many aspects of Higgs boson searches and discovery. It is not
surprising that deep neural networks with several hidden layers do
somewhat better than the single hidden layer or shallow networks
because of a large number of parameters in the deep networks and
building up of the mapping from input to output over several layers.
Therefore, I am not convinced of the novelty or urgency for the paper
to be published in physical review letters. The paper describes an
interesting and useful study and an interesting application. It might
be useful to include more details regarding the deep neural network
training, provide comparisons with performance of single hidden layer
network to clearly demonstrate the gains, and publish a detailed paper
in Physical Review D.

Authors:Thank you for finding our application interesting, we will respond in detail to your questions below. As 
we know, most people use the neural network that combines many observables to form new 
discriminators to separate signal and backgrounds, while in this paper, we exploit the idea to use the 
neural network to approximate variables that cannot be directly measured. We then applied this method 
on an interesting physics problem and provided the first generic way of measuring the VBS polarization 
fraction using any multi-variate technique. The choice of Deep-learning algorithm in this case was 
motivated by gains seen by (references), in situations where high level variables are not known. Other 
regression techniques, including signal layer neural network, could be used. A discussion of the merits of 
deep versus single neural networks is not intended to be the focus of this paper. Other papers addressing
this topic can be found in the literature, for example, references

Following are some specific comments and suggestions that should to be
addressed.

1. Page 2, paragraph 2: The authors suggest that multivariate
techniques have not been used directly to measure underlying physics
quantities of interest. MVA regression techniques have been used by
Tevatron and LHC experiments (CMS) to estimate energy scale and energy
resolution of photons and jets. This is no different from using MVA
regression to directly measure a physics quantity. (Monte Carlo
studies have been made to measure top mass or Higgs mass from event
kinematics using MVA regression.)

Authors: 
Thanks you for bring this to our attention, since we were not able to find this information publicly available.
We changed this to read.

While it has become a common practice in high energy physics to use
multi-variate techniques to separate signal from background, multi-variate
regression is not commonly used to measure underlying physics quantities of interest.

2. How many events were generated and used for deep network training?
Did the training of single layer network also use the same number of
events? What was the architecture of the best single layer network?
The 20% improvement in cost value, presumably is for events generated
at the parton-level?

Authors:500,000 events where used for training and another 1 Million for testing and validation.
Single layer training was done with the same data

3. Fig. 1: In the text, authors refer to Fig. 1(a), 1(b) etc. and the
plots in figures are not labeled as such. Also, the ordinate labeled
as ?A.U.? This should be changed to, say, ?Events (arbitrary units)?.

Authors: A.U. represents arbitrary units, we will correct the labels.

4. Fig. 2.: The top and bottom axes are confusing. Suggest remaking
the plot with gaps between groups to indicate axes values of -1 and +1
appropriately, or have five different plots arranged side-by-side.
Cos(theta)_2^NN values should be shown as -1., -0.6, .. etc., not as a
continuous variable as the top axis presently suggests.

Authors:We have add additional space between groups as you suggest, and modified the labels.

5. The deep network results with events generated at parton-level
yield a 68% confidence level limit on the LL fraction of (6.7 +/-
1.4)% whereas with modeling of detector simulation, this becomes (7^+5
-6)%. This result is then compared to results obtained using the
single R_pT variable (which does not have good discrimination). What
would the result be with single layer neural network using the same
variables as the deep network? How much gain does the deep neural
network provide relative to the shallow network in the scenario with
detector modeling? What is the expected effect of the pile-up problem
at the HL-LHC on the significance of the result and the relative gain?

Authors:The focus of this paper is to use the neural network regression technique to approximate a physics 
quantity that cannot be directly measured and to apply it on the physics problem that is directly related to 
electroweak symmetry symmetry breaking. Since there can be many different ways and parameters to 
train single and multiple layer network, we choose to not directly compare the results. 
In the case the gains in deep were similar to the decrease in cost, however, we will refer to the general 
comment above. To some degree the effect of pileup is included in the delphes simulation, however, we feel
that VBS processes warrants dedicated detector studies by the collaborations.

This is an interesting application of a powerful machine learning
technique to an important topic at the LHC: the measurement of
longitudinal vector boson scattering. Usage of deep learning has
grown considerably in many disciplines recently with powerful results
on extracting information.  The application to this measurement is
still challenging, and with the integrated luminosity expected to be
delivered by the HL LHC upgrade the longitudinal scattering fraction
would be measured to 1 standard deviation from zero with realistic
parton showering and detector smearing, essentially the same as for a
measurement using a proxy variable RpT known in the literature. However
the allowed range for the longitudinal fraction would be significantly
decreased (upper allowed fraction), showing additional statistical power
available when deep learning is applied to all the measured quantities
in this underconstrained final state system. So while the application of
deep learning to this measurement has not made a breakthrough in order
to definitively establish this scattering at its expected level in the
Standard Model at the LHC, it has significantly narrowed the measurement
range possible and hopefully warrants further refinements in future work
to improve the performance further still.  Thus I agree that it is worth
publishing in PRD.

===> Thank you very much!

In reading the manuscript, I assume that the training was done only on
the parton-level information and not retrained after the application
of parton showers and the detector simulation. One question I had was
whether retraining on the final observed variables after this smearing
could possibly improve upon the final results shown (although obviously
not to the level of the original unsmeared parton variables)?

===> Indeed the training was only performed based on the parton-level
     information. Retraining after parton shower and detector
     simulation is a next step planned within the LHC experiment we
     participate in, as mentioned in the paragraph prior to the
     conclusions. For this improvement we foresee that the network
     structure may have to be adjusted to maximally take advantage of
     the presence or lack of extra jets in the event.

Just one minor editorial note on p.3, right column: “…these events
are parton-showered using Pythia and passed through…” sounds somewhat
jargony.  Perhaps “these events are passed through the application of
parton showers in Pythia and then through…”

===> Thank you very much for pointing this out. We followed your
     suggestion with a minor modification. The sentence reads now:
     “…these events are passed through the application of parton
     showering in Pythia and then through…”
